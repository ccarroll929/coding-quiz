# Title: JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description: In this project I used JavaScript to develop an application containing a timed multiple-choice quiz. The application features a countdown timer and score system that stores and displays the users current score and highest score upon completion. It will also penalize users for incorrect answers by subtracting time from the clock.
